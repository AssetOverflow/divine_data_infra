# Retrieval & Personalization Roadmap

## Multi-Agent Retrieval Roles

| Agent Role | Primary Responsibilities | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Query Orchestrator | Normalize incoming search intent, detect domain/topic, and dispatch tasks to downstream agents. | User query text, conversation history, tenant configuration. |
| Retriever | Generate vector + keyword lookups across scripture, commentary, and user-generated notes. | Document embeddings, BM25 indices, metadata filters (language, denomination). |
| Reranker | Apply cross-encoder scoring to shortlist retrieved passages for relevance and diversity. | Retriever candidate set, reranker model weights, passage metadata. |
| Synthesizer | Compose final response with citations and personalization hints. | Reranked passages, user profile traits, stylistic preferences. |
| Feedback Listener | Capture explicit thumbs-up/down, dwell time, and follow-up queries for continuous learning. | Event stream, user/device identifiers, content IDs. |

### Data Needs by Stage

1. **Ingestion Layer**
   - Structured content: canonical scripture texts, translations, topical commentaries, sermons.
   - Unstructured content: audio transcripts, community discussions, study guides.
   - Metadata: language, tradition, topical tags, author attribution, publication cadence.
2. **Indexing Layer**
   - Embeddings (dense + sparse) refreshed weekly or on change events.
   - Passage-level features (length, sentiment, theology tags) for reranking.
   - Historical interaction logs for collaborative filtering.
3. **Personalization Layer**
   - User traits: denomination, engagement goals, preferred formats.
   - Session context: current series or study plan, recent activity.
   - Safety controls: age bracket, parental settings, content sensitivity levels.
4. **Feedback Layer**
   - Real-time interaction events for closed-loop tuning.
   - Aggregated analytics for model evaluation and A/B testing.

## Milestones

1. **MVP Retrieval Stack (Month 1-2)**
   - Stand up orchestrator, retriever, reranker services with baseline datasets.
   - Ship instrumentation for query + passage level analytics.
2. **Personalization Beta (Month 3-4)**
   - Integrate user profile store and personalization signals into synthesizer.
   - Launch adaptive prompts and sermon/study recommendations.
3. **Adaptive Feedback Loop (Month 5+)**
   - Enable feedback listener to push updates into retriever/reranker fine-tuning.
   - Evaluate reinforcement signals with guardrails and human-in-the-loop review.
