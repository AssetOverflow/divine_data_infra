"""
Health check router for API uptime monitoring.

Provides a simple health check endpoint for load balancers, monitoring tools,
and orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes).

The endpoint returns a minimal JSON response with no database dependencies
for fast response times even under heavy load or database issues.

Example Usage:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/v1/healthz
    # Response: {"ok": true}
    ```

Integration with monitoring:
    ```yaml
    # Kubernetes liveness probe example
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /v1/healthz
        port: 8000
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
    ```
